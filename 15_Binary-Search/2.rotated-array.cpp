Summary Notes (Perfect for Revision):
Rotated sorted array = sorted array rotated at some index

1. Always one half is sorted
2. Use binary search logic:
3. Check which half is sorted
4. Decide which half to search next
5. Time: O(log n)
6. Space: O(1)
Very useful for searching in rotated datasets

ğŸ›  Practical Real-Life Example:
Imagine you're searching for a movie in a TV schedule app that was sorted by time but got shifted (rotated) for a new update. You want to find "Iron Man".

Example schedule (rotated):
["Spider-Man", "Thor", "Iron Man", "Avengers", "Ant-Man", "Batman"]
The app uses binary search in rotated array to quickly find "Iron Man" in log n time instead of going one by one.x
